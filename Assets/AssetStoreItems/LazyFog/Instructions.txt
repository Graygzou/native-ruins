LazyFog is a simple fog shader / material for unity's built in particle system  

To familiarize yourself with the shader parameters, please play around with the example scene! 

We recommend you to visit our homepage http://www.lemonspawn.com for general instructions.

The main resource you need from this package is the fog shader, located at Shaders/LazyFog. To use this shader in your project,
copy it into the assets directory and create a material that uses this shader. 

Then, create a particle system using billboard renderer (with no max particle size) and assign the fog material to the renderer. Check out the properties of the particle system 
included in the example scene.
