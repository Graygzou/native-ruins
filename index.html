		Native Ruins is a 3D survival game made for a school project at the Université du Québec &#224 Chicoutimi (UQAC). The course is the following : <a href="http://cours.uqac.ca/8INF871">Design Principles and Video Games Development (8INF955)</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		You play as Judy, a young 23 years old woman, who wake up on a desert island. Her goal is simple : escape the island. To done it, she will need wood, rope and a sail to build a raft. As she goes throught her adventure, she will discover totems that will give her more habilities usefull for archive her goal.

		You play as Judy, a young 23 years old woman,  who wake up on a desert island. She wonders how she gets there but she can't figure it out due to her lack of memories. The only things she got right now, are her empty bag, and the last pieces of look like a boat.
		</p>
		<p>
		Your goal is obvious: escape from this island. But it's not gonna be easy as the island seems to be wild and hostile... To do so you have to build a skiff. This might be the only option left.
		</p>
		<p>
		Going throught a lot of adventures, fighting against wild animals and surviving into his hostile enviromnent, Judy has to learn to survive by herself and discover this island to accomplished her goal.

	    <p>
	    Native Ruins is survival, open world game. The player can have fun discovering the island and also by solving puzzles. It takes around 30 minutes to finish the game if the player doesn't get too lost in the island.
	    </p>
	    <h3>Scripting (C#)</h3>
	    <p>
	    Here a list of main features we implements in this video game : 
	    <table>
		    <tr>
			    <td>
	    			<ul>	
				    <li>Player movements (ZQSD movement in the camera's direction)</li>
				    <li>Third person Camera (independent from the player)</li>
				    <li>Animals artificial intelligence (movement and behavior)</li>
				    <li>Fighting system (losing health and apply damages)</li>
				</ul>
			    </td>
			    <td>
				    <ul>
					    <li>Bow mechanics (aim toward mouse cursor with body rotation)</li>
					    <li>Player animations</li>
					    <li>Mirror's reflection script (Second Enigme with laser)</li>
					    <li>Physics system bag (dropping objects and interact with them)</li>
				    </ul>
			    </td>
		    </tr>
	    </table>
	    </p>
	    <h3>IA techniques</h3>
	    <h4>Steering Behavior</h4>
	    <p>
	    To make animals move, we decided to implements a steering behavior scripts based on vector forces. By doing that, we did not used the navigation mesh (NavMesh) already implemented in Unity. The class diagramme is available on the same section. By doing that, we let the possibility to improve animals movements way easier like squirrels going up on trees. This movement will not be simple to make only with Unity's NavMesh.
	    </p>
	    <h4>Finite State Machine (FSM)</h4>
	    <img class="class-diagram" src="images/Native/FSM.png">
	    <p>
	    We also decided to implements a Finite State Machine to describe animals behaviors. This allow to make human like behaviors and make it more realistic.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    The agent delegate behavior transitions to the StateMachine class that take care of calling exit(), enter() and execute() functions.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    We decided to code it from scratch and did not used Animation State Machines which could be useful in our case. But we had more controls by doing it that way.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    In addition, as we can see in the class diagram, additionals states can be added easily to the pattern and update agent behavior. The only requirement is the relationship with the State<T> class (extends). 
	    </p>
	    <h3>Puzzles</h3>
	    <h4>Jumping puzzle</h4>
	    <p>
	    Our game contains two jumping puzzles. <br>
	    The first one can be accomplished at the beginning of the game when the player hasn't got any additionals habilities yet. Those will be later add, thanks to spirit totems.
	    </p>

			    </ol>
		    </div>
		    <img src="images/Native/enigme1noted.png">
	    </div>
	    The second puzzle requires all the spirit totems : the bear totem and the wolf totem. That's why, it's the last puzzle in the game.

				    <li>Press E to obtain the rope.</li>

	    </div>
	    <h4>Mirror puzzle</h4>
	    This puzzle is inspired from prince of percia : the player has project a laser coming from a point A to another point B to lift a fence. He can move mirrors along the room to allow the laser beam in the right direction. To not frustrated user with this puzzle, we decided to restrict to the maximum mirrors movements. <br>
	    We also added the following constraint : mirrors can only be moved in bear form. This helps keep the puzzles order we decided.
	    <div class="puzzle">

				    <li>Push the second bear to hit the further mirror on the other side of the room.</li>
				    <li>Push the last moving bear on the right to meet the beam.</li>
				    <li>Once the gate's open, Press E near the sail to pick it up.</li>
			    </ol>

		    <img src="images/Native/enigme2noted.png">
	    </div>
	    <h4>Action puzzle</h4>
	    <p>
	    Finally, we created an action puzzle where the player has to destroy rocks with his bear transformation. This puzzle is simple but it's the player's job to find out by himself the correct way. 
	    </p>
	    <div class="puzzle">

		    </div>   
	    </div>
	    <h3>Dialogues & Cutscenes</h3>
	    <p>
	    Finally, we decided to creates in-game cutscenes to have a better user-experience. We made a complexe first cut-scene with player animations, dialogues and the game's credits.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    To make it, we implemented managers, that contains data structures, which take care of animations transitions or dialogues's order. Others animations and dialogues are availables when Judy discovers new items or when hints are needed.
